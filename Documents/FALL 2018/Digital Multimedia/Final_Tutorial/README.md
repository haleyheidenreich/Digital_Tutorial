### _What is Sound?_

### Sound comes in a form of vibrations that travel through: air, mediums such as water, liquid, and solids; sounds are produced by continuous and regular vibrations. 
### Noise on the other hand is an unwanted sound.
### When it comes down to digital audio, a microphone for instance converts the sound into an electrical current.

## __Analog vs Digital signal__ 

### An analog signal is when the audio is replicated from the original sound wave (ex: cassette tapes and vinyls).

### Digital audio signal is when you take **samples** of the original sound wave at a specific rate (ex: CDs and Mp3 files).
