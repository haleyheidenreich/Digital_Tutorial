## __Software used for Audio Developement__
---
### There are a multitude of softwares out there that utilize the fundamentals of digital audio, however I am going to show you a list of three free softwares that you can use without having to fork out the expenses on superior software.

1. OceanAudio (Available on Mac, Linux, and Windows)
###  This software is lightweight, not that big to download, and a fast audio editor that will get the job done. It is not that great for heavier projects such as music producing, however, if you want to record some voice overs and such it will do the trick.

2. WavePad (Available on Mac, Android, iOS, and Windows)
### WavePad is a great audio editor that supports compression, batch processing, scrubbing, effects, analysis, etc. It is very straightforward and have mobile versions that you can use while on the go. It is free to use only for your own personal use, once you get into the commercial side of things you have to pay.

3. Audacity (Available on Mac OS X, GNU/Linux, and Windows)
### It is a multi-track audio editor and recorder with an easy to use interface. Not as "supped-up" as Adobe Audition CC, however it is a free, open source, and corss-platform audio software. It was developed by a group of volunteers.
